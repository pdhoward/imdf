# Displaying Indoor Maps with MapKit JS

Use the Indoor Mapping Data Format (IMDF) to show an indoor map with custom overlays and points of interest in your browser.

## Overview

This sample uses the [`importGeoJSON`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkitjs/mapkit/2974044-importgeojson) method from MapKit JS to import data in [Indoor Mapping Data Format (IMDF)](https://register.apple.com/resources/imdf/), and render an indoor map in your browser. The sample app demonstrates decoding, rendering, and styling of a small subset of the IMDF feature types and properties.

Use these examples to create your own indoor map with a style that is consistent with your appâ€™s design. You will need to handle feature categories that are specific to your venue, and configure the map style using your own colors, icons, and level picker.

## Configure Your Sample Code Project

To run this sample code, you need to:
- Run a web server to serve the assets in the root directory of the project.
- Generate a MapKit JS token and copy it into the `jwtoken` file. For more information, see [Creating and Using Tokens with MapKit JS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkitjs/creating_and_using_tokens_with_mapkit_js).
